=== These specific contributions won't be accepted, please make your own fork and be willing to give full support for it.

NOTE: The overall quality of Dux degrades when adding features/options that don't get daily use by the person that primarily added those features/options in the first place. +
You can expect higher quality from forking and doing this work yourself, since you know exactly why you want what you've added and how it should function, while I don't.

* Other Linux kernels, especially `linux-hardened` and `linux-zen`.
** `linux-zen` used to be Dux's default, but it caused some PCs to fail booting while `linux` and `linux-lts` wouldn't.

* Installers & uninstallers for other desktop environments, and any window manager setups.

* Option to disable Flatpaks.
** I would never test for this, that is the issue. Some Flatpaks are chosen on the basis that they function better than the Arch variant, and vice versa.

* Bootloaders with no support for Btrfs snapshots, such as `systemd-boot`.

* Alternative initramfs generators, such as Booster or Dracut.
** A lot can go wrong easily, in a similar way that changing Linux kernels could.

* UEFI secure boot support.

* Encrypted /boot support.

* Ricing oriented:
** Any GNOME plugins from the AUR.
